  <h2 id="introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>The &quot;<b>Architecture and Requirements for Web-based Signage Player</b>&quot; defines precise requirements for web-based signage players.</p>
  <p>The Architecture and Requirements for Web-based Signage Player consist of a number of profiles. Basically, web-based signage is based on the core profile (this document). As necessary, web-based signage systems adopt the other profiles additionally.</p>
  <p>These profiles are also intended to be used as product specification sheets of web-based signage products for vendors, RFP (request for proposal) used by the signage operators to request SDCs (Systems Development Corporations) to develop a web-based signage system , etc.</p>
  <p>Through these activities, the Web-based Signage Business Group aims to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Diffuse web-based signage in the digital signage industry.</li>
    <li>Share technical knowledge of web-based signage in the digital signage industry.</li>
    <li>Find required APIs or functions for web-based signage, and propose the relevant working groups as necessary.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We believe that web-based signage contribute to cost-efficiencies and rich functionalities in the digital signage industry. As a result, we hope that the digital signage industry will grow up increasingly.</p>

  <h2 id="terminology">2 Scope and terminology</h2>
  <p><dfn id="web-based_signage">Web-based signage</dfn> is digital signage whose contents are created using web-technologies. Besides, it has a capability of connecting to a network. It is not a matter whether the network is the Internet or not. The web-based signage includes the terminal in an intranet.</p>
  <p>A <dfn id="player">player</dfn> plays <a href="#contents">contents</a> for <a href="#web-based_signage">web-based signage</a>. It is a set of an <a href="#application">application</a> and a <a href="#runtime">runtime</a>. This document is not aimed for limitation of underlying hardware and the operating system. Basically, <a href="#web-based_signage">web-based signage</a> is based on the core profile (this document). As necessary, web-based signage systems adopt the other profiles additionally.</p>
  <p>An <dfn id="application">application</dfn> is comprised of the software such as frameworks or the libraries for signage. An <a href="#application">application</a> is a set of JavaScript programs and style sheets and HTML. An <a href="#application">application</a> is run on a <a href="#runtime">runtime</a>, fetches contents form a content server, then plays the <a href="#contents">contents</a> appropriately. The architecture and the functions of the applications will be prescribed as the features for <a href="#web-based_signage">web-based signage</a>.</p>
  <p>A <a href="#player">player</a> uses the functions and the expressions which the underlying <a href="#runtime">runtime</a> provides. Basically, they are specified in HTML5 in wide sense. This document does not restrict the use of the functions which are out of scope of this document. <a href="#application">Application</a>s may use such functions and expressions.</p>
  <p>A <dfn id="runtime">runtime</dfn> is a common web browser (e.g. webkit-based browsers, Firefox, IE, etc.) or a web-based application runtime (e.g. Firefox OS, Tizen, Windows 8, etc.) installed in tablets, PCs, STBs, TV (most of current high-end TV products implement a web-browser), etc. On the other hand, it is not a dedicated subset or subset-based derivation of HTML5 in wide sense. Basically, <a href="#runtime">runtime</a> offers functions called HTML5 in the wide sense. Basically, the specifications of HTML5 in wide sense are be specified particularly by W3C.</p>
  <p>This document mainly defines the requirements for <a href="#application">application</a>s. But it implicitly includes the requirements for <a href="#runtime">runtime</a>s because <a href="#application">application</a>s must use web technologies implemented in <a href="#runtime">runtime</a>s to meet the requirements for <a href="#application">application</a>s. Therefore, this document defines the requirements for players (<a href="#application">application</a>s and <a href="#runtime">runtime</a>s).</p>
  <p><dfn id="contents">Contents</dfn> mean everything shown on a digital signage display. The contents of web-based signage are served by a content server through a network. They consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some contents are possibly created using XML-based technologies which are embedded in HTML, such as SVG. <a href="#refsSVG">[SVG]</a></p>
  <p>A <dfn id="scene">scene</dfn> means a part of web-based signage <a href="#contents">contents</a>. In this document, It is limitted to videos and audios. Generally, <a href="#web-based_signage">web-based signage</a> plays a sequence of <a href="#scene">scene</a>s, and shows each <a href="#scene">scene</a> one by one continuously and repeatedly. See the <a href="http://futomi.github.io/Web-based_Signage_Player_Core_Profile/">Core Profile</a> for more details.</p>
  <p>A <dfn id="region">region</dfn> means the area where <a href="#scene">scene</a>s are shown. <a href="#application">Application</a>s can show some <a href="#region">region</a>s and play <a href="#contents">contents</a> in each <a href="#region">region</a> simultaneously on the display. See the <a href="http://futomi.github.io/Web-based_Signage_Player_Core_Profile/">Core Profile</a> for more details.</p>

  <h2 id="types_of_media_data">3 Types of media data</h2>
  <p>The <dfn id="media_data">media data</dfn> in this profile means audio data and video data. The conformant <a href="#runtime">runtime</a> and <a href="#application">application</a> must support playing audio data and video data.</p>
  <p>The conformant <a href="#runtime">runtime</a> and <a href="#application">application</a> which supports playing video data, must support at least one of the video data types as follows:</p>

  <h2 id="auto_play">4 Auto play</h2>
  <p><a href="#web-based_signage">Web-based signage</a> has to continue to play scenes without any user actions. Especially, media  data is needed to be played  automatically controlled by the <a href="#application">application</a><a href="#player"></a>.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, some <a href="#runtime">runtime</a>s which are widely-spread in the world, especially browsers installed in mobile operating systems (e.g. iOS, Android) don't allow scripts to play media data without any user interactions for the purpose of avoiding extra charge by mobile-phone operators.</p>
  <p>The <a href="#runtime">runtime</a> must allow <a href="#application">application</a>s to start playing and pausing media data without any user actions.</p>
  <p>If the <a href="#application">application</a><a href="#player"></a> runs inside a hybrid mobile app and the underlying <a href="#runtime">runtime</a> doesn't allow the <a href="#application">application</a><a href="#player"></a> to start playing media data, the <a href="#application">application</a><a href="#player"></a> may invoke non-standard APIs exposed by the hybrid mobile app framework.</p>

  <h2 id="properties_for_video_scenes">5 Properties for video scenes</h2>
  <p>Videos are shown in the <a href="#region">region</a> as a <a href="#scene">scene</a>. <a href="#region">Region</a>s necessarily don't  have the same width and height as the video. Furthermore, the aspect ratios of the <a href="#region">region</a> and video could be not identical. Therefore, <a href="#application">application</a>s need to support <a href="http://futomi.github.io/Web-based_Signage_Player_Core_Profile/#properties_for_single_image_scenes">the same properties as image scene defined in the Core Profile</a> for showing videos.</p>
  <p>The scene whose content  is a video has 3 properties as follows. The <a href="#application">application</a> must support all properties:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Fit</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This property defines how to scale the video fitting to the size of the region. Applications must support the fitting types as follows at least:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>None</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The video is not scaled at all. The video will be shown as it is in the region. If the size of the video is smaller than the size of the underlying region, margins will appear. The margin will be colored the background color specified for the region (typically, it will be black).</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Meet</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The video is scaled preserving the aspect ratio of the video so that either the width or the height of the video is equal to that of the region, and the whole video is visible. If the aspect ratio of the video is not as same as the aspect ratio of the region, the video will be letterboxed or pillarboxed (i.e. margins will appear on both of the top and bottom sides or both of the left and right sides of the region). The margin will be colored in the background color specified for the region (typically, it will be black).</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Fill</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The video is scaled preserving the aspect ratio of the video so that either the width or the height of the video is equal to the one of the region, and the whole region is covered by the video. If the aspect ratio of the video is not as same as the aspect ratio of the region, a part of the video is invisible.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
    <dt>Horizontal align</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This property defines how to align the video horizontally in the region. Applications must support the horizontal align types as follows:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Left</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The video is aligned so that the left side of the video fits the left side of the region.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Center</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The video is aligned so that the horizontal center of the video fits the horizontal center of the region.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Right</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The video is aligned so that the right side of the video fits the right side of the region.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
    <dt>Vertical align</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This property defines how to align the video vertically in the region. Applications must support the vertical align types as follows:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Top</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The video is aligned so that the top side of the video fits the top side of the region.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Middle</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The video is aligned so that the vertical center of the video fits the vertical center of the region.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Bottom</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The video is aligned so that the bottom side of the video fits the bottom side of the region.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>To implement the fit property, the application can use the <code>width</code>, <code>height</code> attribute of the <code>video</code> element specified in HTML5, or <code>scale()</code> or <code>scale3d()</code> specified in CSS Transforms. <a href="#refsCSSTRANSFORMS">[CSSTRANSFORMS]</a> <a href="#refsHTML5">[HTML5]</a></p>
  <p>The <a href="#runtime">runtime</a> must support CSS Transforms. Besides, the <code>scale()</code> or <code>scale3d()</code> specified in CSS Transforms must  work for the <code>video</code> elements appropriately.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="properties_for_audio">6 Properties for audio</h2>
  <p>An audio content is associated to a <a href="#scene">scene</a> by the control data. The <a href="#application">application</a> must play the audio data following the control data. Audio contents are mainly used for background music or getting attention of passers.</p>
  <p>A <a href="#scene">scene</a> with an audio content  has the properties for the audio data as follows. The <a href="#application">application</a> must support all properties:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Type</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This value represents the MIME-Type of the audio file (e.g. <code>audio/mp3</code>)</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>URL</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This value represents the URL of the audio file.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Loop</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This value represents the flag indicating that the audio data should be replayed more than once, or not. If the value is true, the audio data must be played repeatedly as long as the scene is shown.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>The <a href="#application">application</a> must play the audio content when the scene is shown.</p>
  <p>The <a href="#application">application</a> may use the <code>audio</code> element or Web Audio API to play the audio content. The <a href="#runtime">runtime</a> must support the <code>audio</code> element specified in HTML5 or Web Audio API. <a href="#refsHTML5">[HTML5]</a> <a href="refWEBAUDIOAPI">[WEBAUDIOAPI]</a></p>
  <p>If the loop property above is set to true, the <a href="#application">application</a> may use the <code>loop</code> attribute of the <code>audio</code> element. If the <a href="#runtime">runtime</a> supports the <code>audio</code> element, the <a href="#runtime">runtime</a> must support the <code>loop</code> attribute too, and the attribute must work as expected.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="preloading_media_data">7 Preloading media data</h2>
  <p><a href="#web-based_signage">Web-based signage</a> is required to start playing videos as soon as the scene is shown followed by the control data. The size of a media file is generally big, it is too late to start to load the data when the scene are shown.</p>
  <p>To start playing media data smoothly, the <a href="#application">application</a> are strongly recommended to preload enough  data to start to play before the relevant scene are shown. The <a href="#application">application</a> can create an media element (i.e. <code>video</code> or <code>audio</code> element) and set the <code>src</code> attribute to the URL of the media file before the scene is shown. The <a href="#application">application</a> must not set the <code>preload</code> attribute of the media element to &quot;<code>none</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>metadata</code>&quot;, because setting these value prevents preloading media data. If the <code>preload</code> attribute is needed, the value should be &quot;<code>auto</code>&quot;.</p>
  <p>It is preferable that the <code>canplaythrough</code> event are fired on the <code>video</code> element before the scene is shown. The <a href="#application">application</a> are recommended to start to prepare media element well in advance.</p>
  <p>The <a href="#runtime">runtime</a> must support  the <code>preload</code> attribute of the media element (i.e. <code>video</code> or <code>audio</code> element), and must preload enough media data  unless  the <code>preload</code> attribute is set to &quot;<code>none</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>metadata</code>&quot; purposefully.</p>
